# TabShare – Share Browser Tab Groups via Link

TabShare is a lightweight Chrome / Brave extension that lets you share a browser **tab group** as a link and restore it later.

This project was built mainly to understand:
- Chrome extension APIs
- Tab Groups handling
- Browser security limitations
- Sharing state without a backend

It works locally using **Load unpacked** (no Chrome Web Store required).
